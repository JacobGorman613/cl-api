TODO:
	- make this into a formatted readme with instructions
	- make an updated latex documentation
	- document the zkp stuff (elsewhere)
	- add range constraints to zkp
	- find correct values for constants
	- s_u bug
	- document what is in each output like I do in nym_gen in the diagram
		- note these ones have inacuraccies
	- fix ng3_out to not have unnecessary values
	- handle cases where tests fail in demo
	- improve the last diagram in diagrams
