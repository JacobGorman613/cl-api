DESCRIPTION:
	This API implements deanonymizable credentials as described by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya. Manual usage is supported
	but it is recommended to use the ca and idp schedulers to implement the CA and IDP as described in our diagrams.
TODO:
	- update Protocol Diagram to have correct output types
	- make this into a formatted readme with instructions
	- make an updated latex documentation
	- document the zkp stuff (elsewhere)
	- add range constraints to zkp
	- find correct values for constants
	- s_u bug
	- document what is in each output like I do in nym_gen in the diagram
		- note these ones have inacuraccies
	- fix ng3_out to not have unnecessary values
	- improve the last diagram in diagrams
		- it was rushed to finish before a meeting and is highly informal
